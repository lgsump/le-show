Beyond that, it is also a play on modern language associated in anti-gay rhetoric. ",

This is ultimately very interesting in that he is merely repeating the words, emphasizing the words, that the clergyman was using in his quote. This is similar to what we distinguished in the satire vs. dark humor discussion, as he isn't creating or using fiction to create some moral point, he is merely emphasizing something that has happened. It is also interesting due to the fact that I would be surprised if anyone would normally categorize that as a joke of \"dark humor,\" but it does seem to hit the definition of \"joking about cruelty.\"",
