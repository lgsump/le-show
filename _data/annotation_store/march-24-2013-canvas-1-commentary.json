As a broadcast that focuses on public events and news stories, it might initially seem strange for Shearer to focus heavily on apologies. However, we start to see, especially through his use of satire in his response and conversation with the apologies of the week, that his focal point seems to be on their lack of authenticity. This emphasizes, like what we see especially in the understanding of dark humor, a focus on truth. ",

The play here is that the information that Shearer is reading is in-fact correct and truthful, but now, instead of him providing the satire as the intelligible, he is caricaturizing himself to crticize the idea of someone that plays off the importance of global warming for \"silly\" reasons like thinking the difference in measure from centimeters or inches would make a real difference to reality. What is also interesting here is the play of how the inch is larger than the centimeter, so in a way the character that Shearer is playing is utilizing some knowledge about the subject, yet it is completely misguided and not applicable to the analysis that the character makes. Overall, adding to the criticism of people who criticize the reality of global warming. ",
