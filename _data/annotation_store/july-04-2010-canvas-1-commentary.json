Not only is it true to the definition we saw as \"joking about cruelty,\" but it also fits the bits of theory we saw by Breton. In a fictional piece, one that requires Shearer to write with his own words, how can he derive humor without exaggerating or making a show of the sexual abuse of these children? It seems here, whether entirely intentional or subconscious, Shearer makes the important decision to allow dark humor to emphasize the horrible nature of the events, since the play of words isn't possible due to it being his own.",

This turns us to an important point for dark humor, especially in its relationship to fiction, or for continuity sake, fantasy. For satire, the fantasy shown is usually done as an exaggeration, whereas for dark humor, it is best shown through the emphasis of the real, the horrible. This idea alone gives us a great reason for why dark humor is necessary, as the ability to create gives us something more than just the reality of the horrible things in the world. With dark humor, we can create something that not only starts the conversation about these horrible things, but also gives a hand to our intellect in how these horrible things can be related to horrible ideas that supercede specific situations like power, innocence, truth, etc. ",
