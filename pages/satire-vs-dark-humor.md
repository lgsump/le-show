For example, in your most traditional introduction to satire, let’s use the Cambridge Introduction, the very question of defining satire becomes problematic. Most scholars, according to scholar Johnathan Greenberg, agree that it makes more sense to treat satire like a form that has “family resemblances” (Greenberg 12). An early attempt at making a model that showcases some of the “family resemblances" is Northrop Frye in 1957. It is a two-part model that asserts that satire uses both a “token of fantasy” and a “moral standard” (Frye, 223).

The element of fantasy in satire can range from exaggeration, caricature, or distortion, all which take the scenario beyond realism. Greenberg expresses that satire and the use of this fantasy is what allows us to see the “hard truths about society’s corruption” or things like that which are normally “closed off to the higher genres” (Greenberg 19). A highlight of what Greenberg notes as to the importance of fantasy in satire is that “the indulgence of play can just as easily be seen as satire’s real “purpose” (Greenberg 20).

However, when it comes to dark humor, specifically, Greenberg makes it clear that there should be a distinction. He includes it in his book within the section “What Isn’t Satire?”, if that wasn’t clear enough. For definition’s sake and clarity, dark humor is the “joking of suffering, cruelty, and death,” and a majority of scholars like Greenberg refer to surrealist André Breton’s <i>Anthology of Black Humor</i> as an origin for scholarship on it. Breton cites that the difference between satire and dark humor as: 
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“Satiric and moralistic intentions exert a degrading influence on almost every work of the past that, in some way, has been inspired by that kind of humour.” - Breton pp. XIX </blockquote>
<br>
So the key difference Breton is trying to make is that satire pushes, like much of the “family resemblances” we have talked about, the audience or argument towards some moral answer, whereas dark humor merely emphasizes the truth of the violence or cruelty. However, large criticisms have been made about the appropriateness of dark humor. Many view it as indecent and harmful, especially to those that may have endured the very suffering it jokes about. For some, the idea of humor and play seem to downplay the severity of the suffering or cruelty.
