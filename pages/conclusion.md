As we’ve taken a look into Harry Shearer’s <i>Le Show</i>, and now have a good idea about when, where, and why he seems to use satire versus dark humor, it seems to make some good points, or in the very least, point to some good conversations. Dark humor has and continues to be a controversial topic in the field of comedy as well as in the lives of the common person. Knowing if something is “worth” joking about, or whether or not one should make a certain joke is something that is conscious and healthy about a community of people. 
<br>
<br>
Like briefly mentioned in the beginning, many believe joking about cruelty, suffering, or the death of other people can be seen as making a mockery or a show out of the horrible nature of their reality.
<br>
<br>
However, I think there are a couple points that we see in Shearer’s work that make sense of an argument against that. Firstly, as we saw in his news sections covering the stories about the sexual abuse of children, he makes a very minimal amount of jokes while reporting the news, much less than we would see about any other subject. This showcases that his understanding of the severity of the events is there. Secondly, he made a song about it instead of a sketch. Like we saw in the episode containing the news segment “All in All,” for something that comes up in many episodes, why wouldn’t Shearer capitalize off of the fact that he could easily make a recurring sketch series out of it? It seems that the answer to this lies closely in Shearer’s recognition of the <i>need</i> for the relationship of truth to be intact. The complete exaggeration of satire and sketch was then off-limits, as that is definitely fitting the idea of “making a show” out of something horrible. However, if it was merely to show the truth, why not just do the news segment? <img width="450" height="450" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;" style align="right" src="https://github.com/lgsump/le-show/assets/122332459/d42f2e6c-59e1-4d37-abee-953c6e2356eb">
<br>
<br>
Like we saw in the July 04 episode, the specific relationship that dark humor has with truth is something that keeps intact the horribleness of what happened to the people involved while also bringing together some aspect of creation. In the end, he was playing a character that he wrote, even if it were based on a real person. He then uses his writing of the character to pull together the true and evil nature of these events in a way that pulls back the layers, the complex language, the blubber of the real world. 
<br>
<br>
What he then creates is something that is both real and fiction, something that is real in its horribleness, yet fictional in its execution. It all comes together in a way that directly contradicts that all-too-common criticism of dark humor in that it “makes a show” out of real and true events. This conversation is one that does have value and truth to it, as the intention of true dark humor has to be the revelation of the horrible nature of reality, not the importance of making a joke. 
<br>
<br>
Harry Shearer even hits this point directly in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:
<br>
<blockquote>”‘Deaf Boys’ is certainly as close to the line as you can possibly get. When I first wrote the line, ‘Deaf boys can’t hear me coming,’ I thought, come on now. You can’t really do that.’ Oh yes, I can. I think extremely transgressive behavior deserves extremely transgressive ridicule. How can you be nice and write about something so horrible?” Harry Shearer</blockquote>

As we can see here, Harry Shearer, like Breton before him, sees this relationship that dark humor has with truth and honesty. It becomes more important than any moral action. What might be interesting to think about is how we might view this in comparison to things like apologies. In some instances, having reasoning, routes for success, or strategies for improvement aren’t the necessary or complete pathway to healing. Maybe it is impossible to heal if you only have healing in mind instead of accepting the reality of why you need to heal. What many dark humorists, like Breton or Shearer, might be alluding to with works of dark humor is that tragedy and human suffering isn’t measurable, and by using it in comparison with moral judgment or as a stepping stone to healing, is doing quite the opposite. It puts the nasty, the foul, the ugly, in the shadows.
